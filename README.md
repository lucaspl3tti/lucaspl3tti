# Hi, name's Luca! üåô

I‚Äôm a Junior Frontend Developer and UI / UX Designer with a burning passion for good, clean code and creative Designs! üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## About me

Currently I have over three years of practical Experience in building digital products. It is especially important to me to write Code, that's easy to understand as well as to maintain. Moreover I love to create beautiful and eye-catching designs.

The interest in Webdevelopment already developed in my youth, which was greatly influenced and encouraged by my dad, who at that time build some websites himself like the one for his company.

My first own project was a pokemon fanpage, where I would post news and information about the games. Though it was build with a homepage builder, I got my first experience with HTML and CSS through buildin the design. In the following years I extended my knowledge and learned new things like WordPress and PHP. Furthermore I got the chance, to build on that knowledge in my school's IT-Course.

In 2018 I then began my training as a Webdeveloper at a german digital agency. In the first two years I was active in backend development, but with Time I noticed that I'm a lot more comfortable with Frontend Development, so I switched my focus. After another year I finally completed my training and started at my current position as a Junior Frontend Webdeveloper at another german digital agency.

## What I do

At my current position I'm responsible for the implementation of UIs in web applications, as well as developing shopware plugins / themes with SCSS and JavaScript. Moreover I am developing dynamic PDF-generators with the PDFlib PHP library.

In my freetime my head is also wrapped up with Frontend Development and Design. Currently I love to expand my JavaScript Knowledge as well as building some Applications with Vue.js.
